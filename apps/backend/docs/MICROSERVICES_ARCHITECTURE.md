# Proxy-Stone Microservices Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the proposed microservices architecture for Proxy-Stone, splitting the current monolithic application into four distinct services. This separation will improve scalability, maintainability, and allow for independent deployment of each component.

## Service Architecture

### 1. Proxy Service

**Primary Responsibilities:**

- Core proxy functionality
- Request/response handling
- Caching logic
- Rate limiting
- Authentication/Authorization
- SSL/TLS termination
- Load balancing

**Technical Stack:**

- Node.js/TypeScript
- Express.js
- Redis (for caching)
- JWT for authentication

**Key Components:**

- Request Router
- Cache Manager
- Rate Limiter
- Authentication Middleware
- SSL Manager
- Load Balancer

**Interfaces:**

- REST API for configuration updates
- gRPC for real-time control
- Message Queue for logging and metrics

### 2. Monitoring & Logging Service

**Primary Responsibilities:**

- Log collection and aggregation
- Metrics collection
- Performance monitoring
- Health checks
- Alert management
- Data retention policies

**Technical Stack:**

- Node.js/TypeScript
- Elasticsearch (for log storage)
- Prometheus (for metrics)
- Grafana (for visualization)
- Redis (for real-time metrics)

**Key Components:**

- Log Collector
- Metrics Aggregator
- Alert Manager
- Health Check Service
- Data Retention Manager

**Interfaces:**

- REST API for querying logs and metrics
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Message Queue for receiving logs and metrics

### 3. Management UI Service

**Primary Responsibilities:**

- Web interface for configuration
- Dashboard for monitoring
- User management
- Configuration management
- Service status visualization

**Technical Stack:**

- React/TypeScript
- Node.js/Express (backend)
- Material-UI or Tailwind CSS
- WebSocket for real-time updates

**Key Components:**

- Dashboard
- Configuration Editor
- User Management Interface
- Service Status Monitor
- Analytics Dashboard

**Interfaces:**

- REST API for all operations
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- OAuth2 for authentication

### 4. Control Plane Service

**Primary Responsibilities:**

- Configuration management
- Service discovery
- Dynamic configuration updates
- Service orchestration
- Policy management

**Technical Stack:**

- Node.js/TypeScript
- etcd or Consul (for service discovery)
- Redis (for configuration cache)
- gRPC (for service communication)

**Key Components:**

- Configuration Manager
- Service Discovery
- Policy Engine
- Orchestration Manager
- Configuration Validator

**Interfaces:**

- REST API for configuration
- gRPC for service communication
- Message Queue for events

## Inter-Service Communication

### Message Queue

- RabbitMQ or Redis Pub/Sub
- Used for:
  - Log forwarding
  - Metric collection
  - Event broadcasting
  - Service status updates

### Service Discovery

- etcd or Consul
- Handles:
  - Service registration
  - Health checking
  - Configuration distribution
  - Service location

### API Gateway

- Kong or Traefik
- Provides:
  - Unified API access
  - Rate limiting
  - Authentication
  - Request routing

## Data Flow

1. **Request Flow:**

   ```
   Client -> API Gateway -> Proxy Service -> Target Service
   ```

2. **Logging Flow:**

   ```
   Proxy Service -> Message Queue -> Monitoring Service -> Storage
   ```

3. **Configuration Flow:**

   ```
   Management UI -> Control Plane -> Message Queue -> Proxy Service
   ```

4. **Metrics Flow:**
   ```
   Proxy Service -> Message Queue -> Monitoring Service -> Storage
   ```

## Security Considerations

1. **Service-to-Service Authentication:**

   - Mutual TLS (mTLS)
   - JWT tokens
   - API keys

2. **Data Protection:**

   - Encryption at rest
   - Encryption in transit
   - Secure configuration storage

3. **Access Control:**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Service mesh for internal communication
   - API gateway for external access

## Deployment Architecture

### Container Orchestration

- Kubernetes for container orchestration
- Helm charts for deployment
- ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration

### Infrastructure Requirements

- Load balancers
- Database clusters
- Message queue clusters
- Monitoring stack
- Logging infrastructure

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Preparation

1. Create separate repositories
2. Set up CI/CD pipelines
3. Implement service discovery
4. Set up monitoring infrastructure

### Phase 2: Service Extraction

1. Extract Proxy Service
2. Extract Monitoring Service
3. Extract Management UI
4. Extract Control Plane

### Phase 3: Integration

1. Implement inter-service communication
2. Set up data migration
3. Configure service discovery
4. Implement security measures

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation

1. Load testing
2. Security testing
3. Integration testing
4. Performance validation

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics to Track

- Request latency
- Error rates
- Cache hit rates
- Resource utilization
- Service health

### Logging Strategy

- Centralized logging
- Log levels
- Log rotation
- Log retention policies

### Alerting

- Service health alerts
- Performance alerts
- Security alerts
- Resource utilization alerts

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability:**

   - Horizontal scaling
   - Vertical scaling
   - Geographic distribution

2. **Feature Additions:**

   - Additional proxy protocols
   - Enhanced monitoring
   - Advanced analytics
   - Machine learning integration

3. **Maintenance:**
   - Automated updates
   - Backup strategies
   - Disaster recovery
   - Performance optimization

## Conclusion

This microservices architecture provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable solution for Proxy-Stone. The separation of concerns allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of each component while maintaining clear communication channels between services.
