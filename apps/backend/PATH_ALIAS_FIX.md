# Path Alias Resolution Fix

This document details how we fixed issues with the path alias resolution in the backend project.

## Problem

The compiled JavaScript files in the `dist/` directory contained unresolved `@/` path aliases that caused module resolution errors at runtime.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Added missing `behavior` configuration to `config.cache`**:

   The `behavior` object was missing from `config.cache` in `config/index.ts`, causing a runtime error:

   ```
   TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'backgroundCleanup')
   ```

   We added the `behavior` configuration by explicitly including it from the default configuration:

   ```typescript
   behavior: {
     ...createDefaultCacheConfig(defaultTTL, cacheableMethods).behavior,
     warmupEnabled: cliEnableCacheWarmup || process.env.ENABLE_CACHE_WARMUP === "true",
     cleanupInterval: Number(cliCacheCleanupInterval || process.env.CACHE_CLEANUP_INTERVAL) || 600,
   },
   ```

2. **Fixed missing `.js` extension in import**:

   Added the `.js` extension to the import statement in `server.ts`:

   ```typescript
   import { cacheRoutes } from "./routes/cache.js";
   ```

   Instead of:

   ```typescript
   import { cacheRoutes } from "./routes/cache";
   ```

## Post-Fix Workflow

After making these changes, the following steps should be followed to ensure the backend starts successfully:

1. Build the TypeScript source:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Run the fix-imports script to convert `@/` aliases to relative paths:

   ```bash
   node fix-imports.js
   ```

3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Or run the compiled code directly:

   ```bash
   node dist/index.js
   ```

## Common Issues

If you encounter path resolution errors in the future, check:

1. Missing `.js` extensions in import statements
2. Unresolved `@/` path aliases in compiled JavaScript
3. Missing properties in configuration objects

Remember to run the `fix-imports.js` script after each build to ensure all path aliases are properly resolved.
